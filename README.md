This repository contains a simple, single-page HTML application demonstrating the core functionality required for a user authentication system: user registration (sign-up), user login, and access to a protected route (content).

The project is implemented in a single file (data.html) using HTML, Tailwind CSS for modern styling, and JavaScript for the client-side authentication logic.
User Sign-up: Users can create a new account with a unique username and a password (minimum 5 characters).

User Login: Existing users can log in using their registered credentials.

Protected Route Simulation: Successful login grants access to a "protected content" area, demonstrating role-based access control.

Logout Functionality: Users can securely log out, which revokes access to the protected content.

Simulated Security: User data is persisted using the browser's localStorage.
